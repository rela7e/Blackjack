            <p id="welcome-text">Blackjack is a Casino game where players play against the dealer. Players are given an opening hand of two cards and attempt to get a hand with a value of as close to 21 as possible without going over. Cards are worth their value in points with face cards equalling 10 and aces 1 or 11. A two card combination that results in 21 is called Blackjack!</p>
